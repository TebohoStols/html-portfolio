<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a born-again Christian, my faith is the cornerstone of my life. It provides me with strength and guidance in everything I do, 
from personal decisions to professional ambitions. My journey in faith has been a source of immense joy and resilience, helping me 
navigate through life's challenges with grace and confidence. It is a path that continually renews my spirit and motivates me to 
strive for excellence in all areas of my life.</p>

<p>In my free time, I find joy and relaxation in several hobbies. Chess is a passion of mine, a game that sharpens my mind and strategic 
thinking. I also enjoy the thrill and fast pace of online action games, which provide a fun escape and a chance to connect with others 
globally. Weight-lifting is another hobby that I cherish; it helps me stay physically fit and mentally focused, reinforcing my 
commitment to a disciplined and healthy lifestyle.</p>

<p>Despite the challenges I faced after graduating with a diploma, particularly in finding stable employment, I have persevered. 
I sustained myself through earnings from forex trading and various retail jobs. This period taught me resilience and adaptability. 
Currently, I am dedicated to enhancing my skills in software development through courses on Udemy, including those by Angela Yu. This 
continuous learning journey is vital for my career growth and aligns with my passion for technology and innovation.</p>

<p>My ultimate goal is be impactful to the lives of people, to provide a comfortable and secure future for my family. I have a beautiful son and a loving partner, who I plan 
to marry in December 2024. My aspiration to become a millionaire and drive a McLaren symbolizes my desire not only for financial success 
but also for the freedom and opportunities it will bring for my loved ones. This vision fuels my determination and hard work every day.</p>

<p>Professionally, I aim to become a successful freelancer with expertise in web design and software development. The skills I am acquiring 
are essential to achieving this goal, enabling me to offer high-quality services to clients and secure lucrative projects. By combining 
my technical skills with my intuitive nature, I am confident in my ability to excel in the tech industry, providing innovative solutions 
and making a significant impact.</p>
